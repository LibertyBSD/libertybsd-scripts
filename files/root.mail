Subject: Welcome to [LibertyBSD] 6.2!

This message attempts to describe the most basic initial questions that a
system administrator of a [LibertyBSD] box might have.  You are urged to save
this message for later reference.

For more information on how to set up your [LibertyBSD] system, refer to the
"afterboot" man page (i.e. after you exit the mail subsystem, type
"man afterboot").  If you are not familiar with how to read man pages, type
"man man" at a shell prompt and read the entire thing.  Pay specific
attention to the "man -k keyword" option, which will permit you to find the
man page you are looking for more easily; for instance, "man -k ethernet".
The GNU "info" subsystem is also installed with further documentation
resources: to read info pages type "info".  (The info subsystem behaves like
the popular emacs editor.)

Again, PLEASE READ THE MANUAL PAGES.  [OpenBSD] developers have spent countless
hours improving them so that they are clear and precise.

If you have installed the X11 file sets during the install process, you can
find further information regarding configuration in the file /usr/X11R6/README.

Several popular binary packages (pre-compiled applications) are available
for [the supported architectures.]

[...]

Significant efforts were made to centralize all system configuration in the
/etc directory.  You should be able to find each of the configuration files
you seek there, lightly documented.  In particular, much of the configuration
has been centralized in the file /etc/rc.conf.  You should not need to ever
edit the file /etc/rc.   The files /etc/rc.securelevel and /etc/rc.local exist
for this purpose; the first is run before the system has gone into secure
mode; the second is run afterwards (if in doubt, add your tools to rc.local).

[LibertyBSD] is free software.  You can do with it as you like, subject to very few
conditions (described at www.OpenBSD.org/policy.html).  But free software isn't
written without money.  Network links, hardware costs, release engineering and
testing work all take money and significant effort on the part of [those who
have made OpenBSD, and, by doing so, LibertyBSD] what it is. [...] 
For information on how you can help, please see
www.OpenBSD.org/goals.html and visit www.OpenBSD.org/donations.html to see a
list of those who have donated money, equipment, or other resources to ensure
OpenBSD continues.

Subject: Some Additional Notes  

LibertyBSD is an unofficial downstream of OpenBSD-- non-free firmware is 
removed, and references to non-free software have been removed.
As such-- and I can't stress this enough-- don't go bothering OpenBSD
developers, users, or anyone that has to do with OpenBSD about issues or 
bugs you encounter. 
Please don't waste their time.
If you believe you have found a legitimate bug, make sure it can be
reproduced in OpenBSD before reporting it to the people I told you not to 
bother.
If you run into any issues, give us a holler at the #libertybsd Freenode 
channel or with the sendbug(1) utility. If it's a software freedom issue
(I.E. you've found something non-compliant with the FSDG in LibertyBSD),
it's probably best if you holler louder. 

If you'd like more information on Free Software or what the Free Software
Distribution Guidelines (FSDG) entail, check the man pages free-software(7)
and fsdg(7).
 
If you'd like to support the brilliant hackers and contributors of OpenBSD
as well as the project's development, please donate to the project or 
foundation. I urge you to donate as much as you would spend on a certain
popular proprietary operating system.
