.Dt UNAME-OBSD 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm uname-obsd
.Nd print operating system name as if it were OpenBSD
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm uname-obsd
.Op Fl amnprsv
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm uname-obsd
utility operates in exactly the same way as
.Xr uname 1
except that the operating system name is printed as "OpenBSD".
.Pp
This is useful when building software that checks the operating
system's name using
.Xr uname 1
but doesn't know about LibertyBSD. And example of this is the GNU
build system's config.guess/config.sub files.
.Pp
To use uname-obsd when building, simply issue the command
.D1 alias uname=/usr/bin/uname-obsd
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Behave as though all of the options
.Fl mnrsv
were specified.
.It Fl m
Print the machine hardware name.
.It Fl n
Print the nodename (the nodename may be a name
that the system is known by to a communications
network).
.It Fl p
Print the machine processor architecture name.
.It Fl r
Print the operating system release.
.It Fl s
Print "OpenBSD".
.It Fl v
Print the operating system version.
.El
.Pp
If no options are specified,
.Nm uname
prints "OpenBSD", as if the
.Fl s
option had been specified.
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std uname-obsd
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr uname-obsd 1
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in LibertyBSD 5.8.
